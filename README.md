# Mixed Messages README file

## Introduction
This project was created as part of the Codecademy Full Stack course. It did not require building the site with HTML and CSS but I elected to.

## Objective
This page's objective is to create ideas for meals. To do that it randomly picks from four arrays to produce a randomised meal. The arrays are:
1. Cooking  style (baking, grilling etc)
2. Meal base (chicken, tofu etc)
3. Accompanyment (broccoli, kale etc)
4. Carbohydrates (Rice, potatoes etc)

## Usage
The "Generate" button accesses the JS script. This is in two parts:
1. The creation of the randomised meal idea
2. The DOM interaction (receiving button input, displaying results)

The "Pin" button runs more script that displays a pinboard of "saved" ideas and pushed the most recently generated idea to it.

The "Clear" button clears this list.
